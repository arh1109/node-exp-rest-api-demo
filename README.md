# node-exp-rest-api-demo

Simple app I designed for one of my final projects in college. This repository is used along with another repo here. <https://github.com/arh1109/transparent-login-form-nodejs>

Here is a design for my app. This project contains the middle Node.js app. Basically the app is a Rest API that is used to connect to a MongoDB database. It offers services for registering new users and authenticating users.
